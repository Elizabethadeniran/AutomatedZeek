THE GOLD LENDER OF BABYLON
==========================

Fifty pieces of gold! Never before
had Rodan, the spearmaker of old Babylon,
carried so much gold in his leather wallet.
Happily down the king's highway from the palace of his
most liberal Majesty he strode. Cheerfully the gold clinked
as the wallet at his belt swayed with each step-- the sweetest music he had ever heard.<END>
